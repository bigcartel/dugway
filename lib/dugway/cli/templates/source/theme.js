// This is where all of the JavaScript code is handled for your theme.
//
// We recommend you break your JavaScript into multiple files and put them in a separate
// directory. We've used a "javascripts" directory in our example below. After that we'll use
// Sprockets (getsprockets.org) to package them into one file. Sprockets also allows you to
// use CoffeeScript (coffeescript.org) by ending your file name with .coffee.
//
// However, if you don't have much JavaScript, or you're just a glutton for punishment,
// you could simply put all of your JavaScript in this file. It's up to you.

// Here we're including a couple CoffeeScript files written for different areas of the store, we're 
// also including jQuery in our layout.html from Google so that it can be better cached by users.
